# mensabot
This is the R script of the Mensabot [@mensabot_BIN](https://twitter.com/Mensabot_BIN). A Twitter bot tweeting daily University of Zurich mensa menus for the Binzm√ºhle location.

The code is heavily based on the [Vegibot](https://github.com/ureber/vegibot) which was inspired by [this](http://www.r-datacollection.com/blog/Programming-a-Twitter-bot/) great tutorial.
